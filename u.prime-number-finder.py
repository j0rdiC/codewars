# PRIME NUMBER FINDER - https://www.codecademy.com/code-challenges/code-challenge-prime-number-finder-python

# Create a prime_finder() function that takes in a number, n, and returns all the prime numbers from 1 to n (inclusive). As a reminder, a prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself.

# For example, prime_finder(11) should return [2, 3, 5, 7, 11].

def prime_finder(n):
    for i in n:
        pass


prime_finder(11)
